# Pull Request [üîó](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
## When and Why?
- **When:** propose and collaborate on changes (proposed in new branch) to a repository. 
  new_changes_branch 
- **Why:**  ensures that the **default branch (usually `main`) only contains finished** and approved work.

## THE GOLDEN RULE OF HISTORY REWRITING
<p style="color: #f25f60; font-size: 15pt; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">"Don‚Äôt push your work until you‚Äôre happy with it"</p>

**Locally** --> rewrite history how you want without problem

**Shared/Pushed** --> consider pushed work as final, really hard to change

## Signing Commits (Firmare/Certficiare i commit)

**WHY sign a commit ?**
- certify your authorship
- be a nice person
- on github signed commit have ‚úÖ emoji

**How to configure signature:** usefull link ---> [GPG üîó](https://central.sonatype.org/publish/requirements/gpg/)
- create own key-pair running on terminal 
  `gpg --gen-key`

  `gpg --list-keys`
- distribute it to a key server so that users can validate it using command: 

  `gpg --keyserver <KEY-SERVER> --send-keys <YOUR-PUBLIC-KEY>`

  Use on of the following GPG keyserver:
  - `keyserver.ubuntu.com`
  - `keys.openpgp.org`
  - `pgp.mit.edu`
- configure git to use generate key for signing (firmare) files 
  
  `git config --global user.signingkey <YOUR_KEY_ID>`

### Configure git to sing commits
1. run `git config commit.gpgsign true` (To sign all commits by default in any local repository on your computer, run `git config --global commit.gpgsign true`)
2. When committing changes in your local branch, add the `-S` flag:

  ```bash
  $ git commit -S -m "YOUR_COMMIT_MESSAGE"
  # Creates a signed commit
  ```

**IF FAIL WITH ERROR LIKE:**
```bash
error: gpg failed to sign the data
fatal: failed to write commit object
```
1. try to run with `GIT_TRACE=1` command before commit commands to see which is the problem

2. try to resolve with command: `export GPG_TTY=$(tty)` (probably it doesn't prompt you for password to sing commits)

## Stashing [üîó](https://unibo-spe.github.io/08-advanced-git/#/3)

Stashing takes the dirty state of the working directory‚Äâand saves it on a **stack** of *unfinished changes* that you can *reapply at any time*

### Main commands
- `git stash`
  Pushes all dangling changes (staged or unstaged) to the stash
- `git stash list`
  Shows all the accumulated stashes (each item has an index `N` that you can use with following commands)
- `git stash apply` 
  restore last pushed edit and keep it on stack 
- `git stash apply stash@{N}` (eg. `git stash apply stash@2`)
  restore `N`-th pushed edit and left it on stack
- `git stash apply --index` the changes that were staged at the time of push get re-staged
- `git stash drop stash@{N}`
  Deletes the N-th stashed change
- `git stash pop`
  - Re-applies the most recent stash, removing it from the stash
  - Same as `git stash apply && git stash drop stash@{0}`

## Rebase [üîó](https://unibo-spe.github.io/08-advanced-git/#/7)

**Rebasing** provides a way to alter the project history by *changing the parent* of (re-base) existing commits

In other words (in italiano üáÆüáπüçïüçù): un blocco di commit consecutivi di una linea di sviluppo (tutti quelli di un branch o da un punto in avanti) vengono presi ed agganciati all'ultimo commit di un altro branch.
Cambi il commit iniziale di quella sequenza di commit che prendi.

### Practical example with commands
#### Before rebase (fast-forward)
```mermaid
flowchart RL
  HEAD{{"HEAD"}}
  master(master)
  experiment(experiment)
  C3([3]) --> C2([2]) --> C1([1])
  C4([4']) --> C3

  master -.-> C3
  experiment -.-> C4

  HEAD -.-> C4
  HEAD --"fas:fa-link"--o experiment

  class HEAD head;
  class master,experiment branch;
  class C1,C2,C3,C4,C5,C6,C7,C8,C9,C10 commit;
```
- move to branch i wanna rebase:
  
  `git checkout experiment`
- rebase current branch commits to destination branch (in tha case `master`):

    `git rebase master`
- go back to destination branch and do a merge:
  
  `git checkout master && git merge`

#### After rebase (fast-forward)
```mermaid
flowchart RL
  HEAD{{"HEAD"}}
  master(master)
  experiment(experiment)
  C3([3]) --> C2([2]) --> C1([1])
  C4([4']) --> C3

  master -.-> C4
  experiment -.-> C4

  HEAD -.-> C4
  HEAD --"fas:fa-link"--o master

  class HEAD head;
  class master,experiment branch;
  class C1,C2,C3,C4,C5,C6,C7,C8,C9,C10 commit;
```
### Advanced rebase

```mermaid
flowchart RL
  HEAD{{"HEAD"}}
  master(master)
  server(server)
  client(client)

  C10([10]) --> C4([4]) --> C3([3]) --> C2([2]) --> C1([1])
  C6([6]) --> C5([5]) --> C2
  C9([9]) --> C8([8]) --> C3

  master -.-> C6
  server -.-> C10
  client -.-> C9

  HEAD -.-> C6
  HEAD --"fas:fa-link"--o master

  class HEAD head;
  class master,experiment,client,server branch;
  class C1,C2,C3,C4,C5,C6,C7,C8,C9,C10 commit;
```
We want to leave `server` as is, but rebase `client` onto `master`

Option `--onto` can be used to transplant entire branches
* `git rebase --onto destination start end`
    * pick commits from `start` to `end`
    * reply them starting from `destination`

With command `git rebase --onto master server client` we are saying:
- *pick all commits from `server` (excluded) to `client` (included)
- remove them and reply them starting from `master`*

```mermaid
flowchart RL
  HEAD{{"HEAD"}}
  master(master)
  server(server)
  client(client)

  C10([10]) --> C4([4]) --> C3([3]) --> C2([2]) --> C1([1])
  C6([6]) --> C5([5]) --> C2
  C9([9']) --> C8([8']) --> C6

  master -.-> C6
  server -.-> C10
  client -.-> C9

  HEAD -.-> C6
  HEAD --"fas:fa-link"--o master

  class HEAD head;
  class master,experiment,client,server branch;
  class C1,C2,C3,C4,C5,C6,C7,C8,C9,C10 commit;
```

## Squashing [üîó](https://unibo-spe.github.io/08-advanced-git/#/16)

**In a few words:** collapse some commits into a single one (usefull if you make some experiment and commit changes and afteer you just wanna keep less commits but all changes)

- Allows to **forget ‚Äúexperimental‚Äù** commits
- Allows to **merge temporary changes into a single one**
- **Simplifies history**
- Alters history
- Can be performed via merge or manually

#### Command

`git reset --soft <COMMIT>` where `COMMIT` is reference of last commit you wanna collapse (squash) starting from HEAD.
In other word you squash from HEAD to *some commit*.

    0Ô∏è‚É£ <-- 1Ô∏è‚É£ <-- 2Ô∏è‚É£ <-- 3Ô∏è‚É£ (HEAD)

after squashing with ```git reset --soft HEAD~3 && git commit``` bacame:

    0Ô∏è‚É£ <-- 1Ô∏è‚É£ (HEAD)

where inside commit 1Ô∏è‚É£ there are also changes of previous commits 2Ô∏è‚É£ and 3Ô∏è‚É£.

#### Squashing using branches

1. create new branch (eg. commits-to-squash `git branch commits-to-squash-branch`)
2. go back to the last commit you wanna keep in history of final branch (eg. master) `git reset --hard HEAD~4`
3. merge the branches squashing/collapsing commits into one in final branch --> `git merge --squash commits-to-squash-branch && git commit`
4. delete temporany branch `commits-to-squash-branch`

## Squash, merge, or rebase?
Squashing results in *further alteration* than rebase

- **Merge** when you **want to retain history**, keeping **track of what happened**
- **Rebase** only when **you are the only one with the commits**, to favor linearity
- **Squash** when some of the *commits are* somewhat *‚Äútests‚Äù*, points in time you **do not want to get back** to anyway


## Make custom git command
Every script executable can be used as command of git with `git-`*name of scritp*.

- create script or program executable (no specific language needed)
- call it using `git-`*script-name* 


## Git Hooks
Scripts that execute when some events happen, stored in `.git/hooks`
They are **not part of the repository code**, and hence **they cannot get commited and pushed**, CANNOT TRACK HOOKS, THEY ARE ONLY LOCAL.

Events also dictate the file names:
- `applypatch-msg`
- `commit-msg`  
particularly useful to enforce a commit message format! When you commit without message you are prompted to editor and then the message is used by `commit-msg` script and then make commit with message provided
- `fsmonitor-watchman`
- `pre-applypatch`
- `pre-commit`
- `pre-merge-commit`
- `pre-push`
- `pre-rebase`
- `pre-receive`
- `prepare-commit-msg`
- `post-update`
- `push-to-checkout`
- `update`
